                   <h2 >An Introduction</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Jesse Falleur, and you are on my website. I'm a native of St. Petersburg, FL, but I've been living in Missouri for the past 4 years, and my wife and my dog are my world.
</p>
<h2>Why do I have a website?</h2>
<p>My hope is to show you that I know my way around making a button, navigational tool, and I'm not a stranger to Javacript too. If you want to make sure I'm a human being, feel free to check out my socail media below. I hope you'll consider me as a potential contact in your company. 
</p>

<h2>Where was I born and bred?</h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, I was born in a small town called, McKinney in the great state of Texas. However, I pulled up roots and moved to Florida in another small town called Largo, and lived there till I was 12 years old. My mother, a mortgage manager was the breadwinner and we lived in several states in the South including; Lousiaana and Alabama. However,  we ended up moving back to Florida eventually living in New Port Richey which is a few hours north of where I grew up. I've really enjoyed visiting differnt places due to my college education like Mexico, and Canada, and really feel that it has made me a more well-rounded person. 
</p>
<p>After college I spent a year in Canada, because of a chance to be a music minister for a small church in Perth. I had a rare opportunity to move to Dallas and go to K.D. Conservatory and learn from filmmkaing professionals. I guess I was always interested in stories and how all of these individual people put together a movie. I'm excited by the opportunities that software development provides for several different industries. My heart to make an impact on the world especially in regards to education and protecting a child's innocence. My experience with working on set was amazing and made me believe it is possible to make money and enjoy life simulataneously. However, the past predicts the future and eventually I had to move back to Florida due to my Mom having cancer.
</p>
<h2>Why did I leave Florida for Missouri?</h2>
<p>So there's this very special woman, who if I talk about her she gets shy, so I will say it's because I met my soulmate and we really hit it off. I married her after about 11 months of dating, in the middle of Covid madness in a church that was the only approved place, a small dot of a light, in a giant void of darkness. We have a dog named Titus. He's Safford Shire-Terrier and part stubborn. We love him, because he is cute though. My wife became disabled in 2021 and we are still appealing for at the time of this writing. Everything I do is for my wife and my dog.
